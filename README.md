- 🎧 Building a **MCP server** for my employer that **mines and enables quick access** to libraries of audio recordings.
- 🔧 Building a **VSCode plugin** that enables easier access to your chats with GitHub Copilot
- 🔧 Leading development of an **open-source candidate project** - a collection of server utilities aimed at **auditing remote servers**.
- 🌐 Running **minademian.com**, my evolving portfolio.
- 🌐 Maintaining [**The Craft Table**](https://blog.minademian.com), my personal tech blog.

I’m deepening my expertise in **React**, **TypeScript**, **Java**, **CI/CD**, **system design**, **software design and architecture** towards staff-level impact, system coherence, and scalable abstractions.
