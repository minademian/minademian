I design and build systems that balance clarity, performance, and long-term maintainability.

Currently:

- ☕ Maintaining two **Java packages in production**, exploring developer tooling and cross-platform desktop applications.
- 🔧 Leading development of an **open-source candidate project** for my employer, focused on **modular architecture**, **testing rigor**, **improving code coverage incrementally** and **transparent engineering practices**.
- 🌐 Running **minademian.com**, my evolving portfolio.
- 🌐 Maintaining [**The Craft Table**](https://blog.minademian.com), my personal tech blog.
- 🎧 Building a **MCP server** for my employer that **mines and enables quick access** to libraries of audio recordings.

I’m deepening my expertise in **React**, **TypeScript**, **Java**, **CI/CD**, **system design**, **software design and architecture** towards Staff-level impact, system coherence, and scalable abstractions.
